# IZV-ISST_online_tour
The program compiles panoramic (360-degree) images taken with a mobile phone, depicting the premises of RTU IZV and ISST (Āzenes Street 12, Riga, Kurzeme District, 4th floor). The website displays these images and allows the user to navigate by clicking arrows that are either embedded in the image itself or exist only in the user interface.
